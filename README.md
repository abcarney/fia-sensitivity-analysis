# FIA sensitivity Analysis

The two R scripts produce the sensisitivity analyses completed as part of the Zoom valuing exercise in FIA Spring 2021. The two primary files for this analysis are:
* zoom_sensitivity_analysis_helper.R: this file creates functions that take in a set of historical data assumptions and produce a fundamental value for the company
* zoom_sensitivity_analysis.R: this file actually conducts the analyses using the helper functions in the file above

Also included are three csvs, two which provide the historical data used in the analysis and one which has the forecasting assumptions that will be used based on our investment thesis.
